# Fake-Valorant-Cheat
I made a fake Valorant Cheat which uninstalls the Valorant from the Cheaters computer. 
I used Visual Studio 2022 with the .NET Framework to make this.
Here are some questions and answers you may need:

Is it safe?
Yes, This Fake Cheat does not automatically uninstall the game, it relies on the user to 'Inject' the files.
The 'Inject' button will delete anything from the directory selected (given in TextBox). So it won't harm your PC
in anyway unless you are not paying attention. 
Microsofts Windows Defender may think of it as a virus since it was downloaded from the internet however external
Anti-Viruses show that the file is clean.

Here is the virustotal link (setup file): https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/984c1b717b9faeb25dea6747d793b563313b92fa73b55710a817130d9ca8a1ba

If you want to download the setup file, Here is a MediaFire Link since GitHub has a 25mb limit: https://www.mediafire.com/file/lt44191vm32s5pd/mysetup.exe/file 

Source Code?
Well I can't upload the Project itself but you can get the source code through a decompiler like JustDecompile which will allow you to see how the app works
I will be adding a tutorial video and an explaining video in the future on my YouTube Channel.
